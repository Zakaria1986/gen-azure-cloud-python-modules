# 5. Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations that each result in the number 8. Be sure to enclose your operations in print statements to see the results.
itemPrice = 4
priceIncrease = 4
priceDcrease = 4
# addition
print(itemPrice+priceIncrease)
# subtraction
print((itemPrice*3)  - priceDcrease )
# Muliplication
print(itemPrice*2)
# division
print(round((itemPrice*itemPrice)/2))
  
# 6. Store your favorite number in a variable. Then, using that variable, create a message that reveals your favorite number. Print that message.
