## Dynamically do 'CRUD' to the Dictionary

    # Add new pizza into the pizza list
    
    # Add new property to each of the pizza 

    # Add toppings to the toppings of each pizza or some of the pizza's

## Make this more interactive by adding input for example, let users input the data in console and then added to pizza list
 
 # Check to see if input already exist in the list if not add
 
 # Choose from option which perform CRUD on i.e., add new pizza, add new toppings or add a new property to the pizza's


## Finally print out all the result based on customer option:
 
 # allow list of option from the menue i.e., Pizza's 
 
 # Based on the input show the properties of that Pizza
 
 # if they want to order the pizza calculate and show the total price and end the program.
